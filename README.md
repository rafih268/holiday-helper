# Holiday Helper

> A guide to decide your next holiday destination

## Introduction

This is a program that utilises data structures and algorithms, file access, exception handling, and your general Java programming skills to decide the destination for the next holiday you will be going on.

## Programming concepts

The main concept demonstrated within this project is the use and traversal of tree nodes.

In this project:

- Each node stores the question that the program will be asking to understand the user's preferences.

- The leaf nodes will contain the destination that the program has concluded on based on the user's choices.
